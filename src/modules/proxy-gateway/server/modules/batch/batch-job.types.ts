/**
 * Shared vocabulary for the local batch runner.
 *
 * The provider surface this proxy speaks to (`v1internal` on `cloudcode-pa`) has
 * **no batch plane**: there is no batch resource, no deferred submission, no
 * server-side job. This is a **local deferred-job runner** over the same
 * `generateContent`-family calls the proxy already makes for interactive
 * traffic. It is a real implementation of the client-facing contract -- submit
 * a set of requests, poll, collect results line by line, survive a dropped
 * connection and an app restart -- and it is worth having for clients that only
 * speak batch.
 *
 * It is **not** the economics of a real batch API: there is no 50% discount, no
 * separate quota pool, and no separate rate limit. Every request costs exactly
 * what it would cost sent normally, right now, against the same account leases
 * and the same rate-limit tracking interactive traffic uses.
 *
 * This file owns the runner's vocabulary -- job/request shape, state values,
 * error codes, id parsing. The client-facing protocol surfaces
 * (`/v1/batches`, `/v1/messages/batches`, `:batchGenerateContent`,
 * `/v1beta/batches`) each live in their own controller and resource module
 * beside `batch-runner.service.ts`, one per dialect, wired up in
 * `batch.module.ts`.
